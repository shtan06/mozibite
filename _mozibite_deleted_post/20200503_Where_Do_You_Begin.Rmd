There are many books available for beginners. I started with these:

By the way, you don't need to know Statistics to be able to use R.

For other great recommendations, check out these links:

[Authored by RStudio](https://rstudio.com/resources/books/)

This is a highly recommended book: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

__Learning from Videos and Books__  
There are lots of good tutorials on YouTube too. I won't put any links here because there are so many that I find very informative and easy to look up. For me, I'm old school so I usually start with books. Compared to learning mostly from videos only where I tend to lose pace and flow, I feel that the contents you find in books are more structured to provide a better foundation for beginners to follow.

My personal favourite training resource is from RStudio and contributers/developers like r-bloggers. You can use these as your starting point or as a reference guide later.  
[RStudio Training Resources](https://rstudio.com/resources/training/)  
[RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/)  
[r-bloggers - Learn R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/)  

If you find it difficult to follow, especially if you do not have the basic foundation in programming, I recommend that you get a book that suits your level of IT proficiency first.
