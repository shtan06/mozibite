This site is built entirely on R Markdown site generator in its simplest form with minimum coding, packages and themes. To learn more about R Markdown, go to: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html> or read the book, R Markdown: The Definitive Guide online <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html>.

I will share random stuff on this blog that I think would be useful information for you. I have not opened the site to comments yet. You can contact me at shtan06@gmail.com.

 *"...break (the projects) down to their simplest form and then just make marginal improvements along the way to improve my odds of achieving them."*
 - an inspiring advise from Stephen Duneier who gave a talk on TEDx on how to achieve your goals.
