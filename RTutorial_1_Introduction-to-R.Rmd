## 2. Getting Started

### __Part 2: Getting Started__

<br>

#### Beginning R

<br>

*	Why learn R?
*	The R programming language
*	More about R – environment, community, license, GUI/IDE, packages
* What you need to prepare before you begin your project

<br>

R Data Exploration Workflow

_Source: R for Data Science_ https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html

<br>

#### Installing R and RStudio

<br>

##### • Installing R

*	Go to https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
*	Follow download instructions

<br>

##### • Installing RStudio

There are many R programming IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) and editors. Select one or more that best meet your requirements – for example, the type of license best suited for your environment, budget, platform, R-specific/multi-language, feature strength and integration with other programs.  

• RStudio  
• R Tools for Visual Studio  
• ESS  
• Microsoft R Open  
• Architect  
• Eclipse StatET  
• R AnalyticalFlow  
• Rattle  
• R-Brain  

Throughout this tutorial, we will use RStudio.

*	Go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
*	Select RStudio Desktop (open source license)
*	Download file according to your OS and follow instructions

If you already have RStudio installed previously, you can go to Help > Check for Updates to install the latest version. Re-installation is required but you do not need to uninstall the old version.

<br>

##### • Quick Start


* The RStudio IDE
  + Help Menu – About, Updates and Resources
  +	Code pane
  +	Console pane
  +	Environment pane – Environment, History, Connections, Build, Tutorial
  +	Files pane – Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Viewer

* Entering Codes
  +	Simple calculation examples
  +	Create a variable and calculate its values
  +	The Base R Package
  +	Help (?base, ?sum, etc.)

<br>

#### Resources

1.	R Website https://www.r-project.org/  
2.	RStudio Support https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/sections/200130627-Package-Development

<br>

## 3. Basic Workflow Demo

### __Part 3: Workflow Demo__

<br>

* Project Stages
  + Stage 1
    + Write a business case
    + Identify data source. Analyse data and data structure.
    + Design a plan
  + Stage 2
    + Import Data
    + Clean and transform
    + Code and Plot
    + Communicate

Open file __"Session 1 - Workflow Demo.Rmd"__  

<br>

__Load packages__  

> library(ggplot2)  
library(reshape2)  
library(readxl)  

__Import Data into ae_pop dataset__  

> ae_pop <- read_xlsx("/Users/user/Documents/REnv/World_Population.xlsx",  
                      sheet = "Asia-Europe")  

__Transform Data Structure__  
<br>

* Reshape the table  

> ae_pop <- melt(ae_pop)

* Rename the columns  

> colnames(ae_pop) <- c("Region", "Year", "Population")

__Plot a Graph using ae_pop Dataset__  

>ggplot(ae_pop, aes(x=Year, y=Population, fill=Region))+  
        geom_point(aes(color=Region))+  
        scale_x_discrete(labels = NULL)+  
        scale_y_discrete(labels=NULL)  

__Create a new data frame and plot a pie chart__  
<br>

* Re-arrange columns  

> ae_pop1 <- ae_pop[ae_pop$Year==2020,c(1,3)]

* Plot a pie chart  

>ggplot(ae_pop1, aes(x="", y=Population, fill=Region))+  
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+  
  coord_polar("y",start=0)  

__Summarise some data__  

> summary(ae_pop)  

__Knit this file to send output to HTML, Word, PowerPoint or PDF__  

For PDF, install LaTex first.
